            8/25/23 - We studied how to utilize AWS Cloud 9 during the first week of class to start the process of learning and comprehending how to add various things to our websites. Our first challenge of the day required us to link poles and guid a marble towards a bucket.

            9/11/23 - We started to learn how to use Tinkercad, a website that helps us bring our ideas to life by making a 3-d representation of the object. Our first project was the Rube Goldberg project were we had to incorporate different simple machines.

            9/20/23 - Today, we successfully finished our Rube Goldberg project however, we did have to change a few things from our prototype. For instance, the three legs at the edge of the project did not truley support their side therefore, we taped two of the legs to the lever. We also had to add supports for the second ramp or else the whole project would have collapsed. After adding all of the minor details, we tested it out for the first time with the balloon and to our suprise, it worked!

            9/29/23 - Last class we dissected a computer to learn about the different parts. Moreover, we learned about what each parts purpose is and and got to take the computer apart and put it back together. Unfortunetly, after we tried putting the computer back together, we couldn't get it to work. However, we were able to identify each part of the computer as we took it apart.

            10/6/23 - After learning about the field, bioengineering, we had to try and attempt to make our own prosthetic hand with cardboard, string, rubber bands, and tape. The assignment was to make the hand well enough to pick up a water bottle. Our approach was a more simple one; we cut out fingers and attached strings and rubber bands so it could be easy to close the hand. Therefore, we tried our best and we could only pick up the water bottle for a few second without dropping it.

            10/20/23 - Following our lesson of aerospace engineering, we had a project which required us to create a rocket out of a 2 liter soda bottle, cardboard, and paper. We did approach the design with a more basic look; we used the cardboard to make 3 fins, and made a paper cone for the top. Moreover, we wanted to make our design with lighter materials therefore it wouldn't mess with the action of launching the rocket. When launching the rocket, I would say that it was a success because it did launch successfully; yes, it did kind of spin out of control however, it did launch at a decent height.

            10/26/23 - Moving onto our next lesson, environment engineering, our project was to build a filter system that would change dirt water into clear water. During this project, the materials that we were open to use was rocks, pebbles, cotton balls, and sand. The order in which we use the materials was cotton balls on the bottom, then sand (but not too much), then rocks, then pebbles. After creating the filter, we dumped in the dirty water and altogether it took a long time for some of the water to come back out. The water that did come out of our filter system was a lot more cleaner than the dirt water that we started with. With the more clean water, but not so clean, we put it back into the filter system to see if the water could come out a bit more cleaner to try and get the water to be crystal clear. However, to our disappointment, the water stayed the not-so-clear water, like the first time when the water came out of the system.

            11/3/23 - After our lesson on environmental engineering, we started to talk about electrical engineering. To further understand our lesson about electrical engineering, we did two labs in tinkercad and used objects like the breadboard, resistor, and LEDs. In these labs we had different circumstances in which we had to turn on the LED, or in some cases LEDs.

            11/13/23 - Following our project of trying to turn on the LED through using tinkercad, we used our knowledge from those projects to create our own. Using actual wires, LEDs, breadboard, and resistors, we recreated the projects that we did using tinkercad. After recreating those projects, we took a step forward and connected it to our laptops to try and code the LED to blink. Thereafter we used the computer to code the LEDs to blink with a certain power, messing with how long it blinks or doesn't blink. Moving forward we also figured out how to code to make the LED fade instead of blink.

            11/17/23 - Moving on, we started our projects about Buisness Engineering. For this project, we had to form groups and come up with ideas for a business product and, just like Shark Tank, come up with a business pitch to present to the class. Considering that our group had no idea what product to present, we started to think of issues that we can resolve with a product. Furthermore, that's where we came up with the product AFG (Anti-Fog Glasses). People who wear glasses often run into the problem that their glasses constantly fog up; therefore, we came up with a product that would take away the fog and moreover feel more comfotable with wearing glasses.

      <li>The weight of our bridge was 32.7 grams.</li>
      <li>The weight held by our bridge was 447 grams.</li>
      <li>The ratio / score of our bridge was 13.6. </li>
      <li>The heaviest part of our bridge was most probably the center, as we included more spaghetti pieces in the middle; however, we added more glue towards the handles therefore, we could argue that the handles were the heaviest part of the bridge. </li>
      <li>The design of our bridge was based on each of our own individual  ideas; some people thought it would be better to have a straight line of spaghetti while others thought it would be better to add designs in the middle. At first we all thought it would be a good idea to make the bridge 3D and make some parts of the bridge stand up. However, we quickly realized that that would take too many pieces of spaghetti and we decided to just focus on the support in the center of the bridge. </li>
      <li>Our design had worked a lot better during the practice round because we did not have much of an idea for the design. In addition, we ended up spreading out the support evenly; once we figured out that our design worked, we tried to add more support in different areas. However, because we didn’t spread the support out evenly, our design failed within seconds.</li>
      <li>The point of failure for our bridge was the area where the bucket hung on. Our group had put more support and focus on the center of the bridge as well as the handles. However, we hadn’t thought ahead of how the bucket would put most of the weight towards the area it was hanging on.</li>
      <li>What we could have done was add more support on the sides because that’s where it ended up failing. We had focused more towards the middle and the handles rather than adding support for the areas where the bucket was going to hold. Moreover, we could have added more spaghetti or glue towards that area. </li>

            1/12/24 - Our next and final unit was on chemical engineering! The project for this unit was to make oobleck, a non-Newtonian fluid that acts like both a solid and a liquid; however, we were not told the perfect ratio to make oobleck therefore we had to guess. We had started by pouring all the cornstarch into the tray and adding the water little by little. After some time we had come to the perfect ratio of water and cornstarch which therefore turned into oobleck.

            1/29/24 - After learning about the different branches of engineering, we have moved onto projects that consist of the different branches that we had learned the semster before. Our current project either a mousetrap car or and arduino car; the mousetrap car cover mechanical engineeering while the arduino car covers electrical engineering. My group decided to make the mousetrap; moreover we decided to start the project proposal. In the project proposal we did our research on what materials to use and what materials will help our car go a farther distance. In the end we found out that by attatching rubber bands to the exterior of the wheels, it will add traction which will make the car move faster. After the project proposal, we used Tinker CAD to design our car; this also helped us visualize our measurements to make sure that everything will fit perfectly. Following making our design of our car, we will start to build our car and bring it to life.

            2/14/24 - While building the car we ran into some problems. First, we realized that one set of the wheels was not attached to the body of the car other than the string, which was not going to work. We decided to attach a skewer from the body to the wooden rod, however we were met with another problem. If the wooden rod was attached to the body of the car, then the string would not do it's job and make the car move. Therefore, because the wooden rod was too thick to add a straw, we decided to make a triangular shape, giving the wooden rod the space that it needs to make the car move. Moreover, we thought that we were ready to test our car however, the car did not agree. After we wrapped the string around the wooden rod, the car failed to move; We believed that it was due to the carboard piece, that was in the center of the wooden rod keeping the wheel and the body connected. Because of the carboard, we had to put the string onto one side; When we tested it, the wheels flipped over because of how the string was wrapped around one side. Therefore we decided to wrap it on both sides over the carboard piece however that made the car not move at all. Even though it didn't move at all, it was expected to move 348 due to our calculations. After coming to the decision that car will not move, we decided to take our mistakes, learn from them, and apply that towards the next iteration.
