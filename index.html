            8/25/23 - We studied how to utilize AWS Cloud 9 during the first week of class to start the process of learning and comprehending how to add various things to our websites. Our first challenge of the day required us to link poles and guid a marble towards a bucket.

            9/11/23 - We started to learn how to use Tinkercad, a website that helps us bring our ideas to life by making a 3-d representation of the object. Our first project was the Rube Goldberg project were we had to incorporate different simple machines.

            9/20/23 - Today, we successfully finished our Rube Goldberg project however, we did have to change a few things from our prototype. For instance, the three legs at the edge of the project did not truley support their side therefore, we taped two of the legs to the lever. We also had to add supports for the second ramp or else the whole project would have collapsed. After adding all of the minor details, we tested it out for the first time with the balloon and to our suprise, it worked!

            9/29/23 - Last class we dissected a computer to learn about the different parts. Moreover, we learned about what each parts purpose is and and got to take the computer apart and put it back together. Unfortunetly, after we tried putting the computer back together, we couldn't get it to work. However, we were able to identify each part of the computer as we took it apart.

            10/6/23 - After learning about the field, bioengineering, we had to try and attempt to make our own prosthetic hand with cardboard, string, rubber bands, and tape. The assignment was to make the hand well enough to pick up a water bottle. Our approach was a more simple one; we cut out fingers and attached strings and rubber bands so it could be easy to close the hand. Therefore, we tried our best and we could only pick up the water bottle for a few second without dropping it.

            10/20/23 - Following our lesson of aerospace engineering, we had a project which required us to create a rocket out of a 2 liter soda bottle, cardboard, and paper. We did approach the design with a more basic look; we used the cardboard to make 3 fins, and made a paper cone for the top. Moreover, we wanted to make our design with lighter materials therefore it wouldn't mess with the action of launching the rocket. When launching the rocket, I would say that it was a success because it did launch successfully; yes, it did kind of spin out of control however, it did launch at a decent height.

            10/26/23 - Moving onto our next lesson, environment engineering, our project was to build a filter system that would change dirt water into clear water. During this project, the materials that we were open to use was rocks, pebbles, cotton balls, and sand. The order in which we use the materials was cotton balls on the bottom, then sand (but not too much), then rocks, then pebbles. After creating the filter, we dumped in the dirty water and altogether it took a long time for some of the water to come back out. The water that did come out of our filter system was a lot more cleaner than the dirt water that we started with. With the more clean water, but not so clean, we put it back into the filter system to see if the water could come out a bit more cleaner to try and get the water to be crystal clear. However, to our disappointment, the water stayed the not-so-clear water, lke the first time when the water came out of the system.
